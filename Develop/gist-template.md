## Regex Components

### Anchors
This regex contains two anchors - ^ and $

^ refers to code that must appear at the beginning of a string

$ refers to code that must appear at the end of a string

Since this regex contains both of these anchors, strings must match every single specification exactly or it won't be a match.
